Last weekend and early this week, I was extremely busy preparing for and attending interiews 
for clubs. I also thought this would be a partner project, but after opening the page, I 
realized it was solo, giving me five days to work on it. I nearly got all the point necessary
before the deadline, and so I am using these 24 hours to try and get the maximum number of 
points possible.
