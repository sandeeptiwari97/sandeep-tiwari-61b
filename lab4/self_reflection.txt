All questions are optional, though try to answer at least 4. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: 

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

<<<<<<< HEAD
A: I felt quite proud with much of the array sequences I was able to build with the amount
   of code that I ended up using.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: My ‘get’ method wasn’t very efficient because I used a loop to find the index of
   the item. I could have split the array and found the front or end of it. I struggled 
   figuring out a way to implement this method and so I was forced to resort to the 
   inefficient iterative method. 

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: I think I should have thoroughly ensured I understood what an ArrayDeque was, which
   would have made the implementation a bit easier than it was.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A:

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

<<<<<<< HEAD
A: I wished I had used more helper functions rather than trying to put all the code into 
   one method.

   I tried building it.

Meta:

Q: This is the first time we've tried something like this. Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

<<<<<<< HEAD
A: I really like this process a lot because I was able to get an outside perspective 
   about the redundancies and inefficiencies in my code, and we could also just see how 
   others thought about the problem. I don’t really have any changes to make.
   to make to the process,
